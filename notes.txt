- top interval should be trending up 10% (across 2 segments) and trending up 30% (across 5 segments)
 
- smaller interval should be trending up in majority, not just at the end?

- interval MA should be *changing* by +10% or stable at 10%

- C should be close to MA, not strictly above

- use moving volume average instead of strict avg (might not need this actually)

*** MA RATE OF CHANGE UPWARDS IS 100x BETTER THAN ACTUAL TREND ***
