- Start Xming server for graphs

## Notes

- B & C should be above moving average
- 38% to 61.8% retracement (38%, 50%, 61.8%)
- check buyers and sellers at C (a lot of buyers will kill the pullback?)
- time symmetry from A - C and C - D
  \*\*\* use lengths not price diffs
- C should hit prev support/resistance (extrema before A)

\*\*\* find pattern in smaller interval on higher interval uptrend
-> break if 30m/15m interval isn't trending up
-> only trade in 5/3/1m intervals

\*\*\* the key is to identify the overall market trend

??? use avg. market price for trade management, instead of candle
-> candle might drop below support temporarily but close above, avg. market price will lag behind and possibly be more accurate

??? use highs/lows instead of closing prices
-> easier to manage trade

\*\*\* candle after C should be bullish (taller, and positive)

? find first HH and HL
